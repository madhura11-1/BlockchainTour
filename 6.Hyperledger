              There is no mining in hyperledger still the consensus is as strong as bitcoin or ethereum

     Ledger contains : world state - the current sstate of object is gievn by it rathe than traversing the entire transaction log 
                       blockchain - a transaction log that records all the changes that have resulted in the current the world state
      weâ€™re recording the facts about the current state of an object, and the facts about the history of transactions that led to the current state

1. Fabric CA :
               allows to generate cerificate fir fabric bc.
               To do any work on fabric u need a cryptographically signed CA
               kind of authorization required to work ur website under https protocol.
               Ecaj user has a certificate depending on his work in the private bc
               u can put some extra info called attributes inside this 
               Eg : u provide username, password,then u get a certificate from fabric CA
                    so if in ur team there is a project which has accees to only the admins so thru the certificate attributes it can be verified
               like making the enrollment
               then this certificate is given to the sdk where u can then interact with fabric

2 Peer :
            one or many peers
            one peer can participate in many channels   
            just like nodes

3 Ordering Service :
                     provide order of operations
                     before anything is commited it muat pass thru ordering service
                     help in making the block like sending order of transactions to include into block
                     security, policy management,verifications are some jobs of them.

4 Channels : 
             channels are sub-networks of the fabric\
             if there are number of parties and two of them want to do a privtae operations then they can create a channel inside fabric and nobody else can then view info 
             inside it
             each peer has to join the peer
             each party inside the channel mmust agree for all other parties in the channel
             each channel can have diff block height
             every channel has different ledger

5 ChainCode :
               same as smart contracts in the ethereum
               can be writte using golang,node.js, java
               u need to create certain policy before writting it into the ledger like multi signatue or verification thru certain peers in the channel

6 MSP (Memebership service protocol) :
                 the members of a Hyperledger Fabric network enroll through a trusted Membership Service Provider (MSP).

 

       Composer : same as truffle used in ethereum
                  deploys our application
                  sets credentials
                  runs REST server
                  composer playground allows interaction wiht the blockchain network
